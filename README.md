# reading-ints
A C++ program that finds the kth largest number among a set of N numbers. It implements the solution using two different algorithms and measure the time elapsed during the execution of these
algorithms. As input, the program will take the type of algorithm to be applied (1 or 2), k (a number less than or equal to N). Then it will take N followed by
a list of N numbers. All these input values obtained from an input file. As output, it prints out the kth largest number and the total elapsed time for the completion
of the algorithm.
